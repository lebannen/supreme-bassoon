# French A1 Course Plan: A Narrative-Driven Approach

This plan outlines a 10-module course for beginner French (A1 level), based on the communicative principles of the CEFR. The course follows the journey of **Sophie**, a Canadian student, during her first weeks in Paris, where she meets a new friend, **Léo**.

## Guiding Principles for the Course

*   **Narrative First:** Each module is built around an episode in Sophie's story, providing authentic context for all language concepts.
*   **Communicative Goals:** Every grammar point or vocabulary set is introduced to help Sophie accomplish a real-world task.
*   **Spiral Curriculum:** Key concepts are introduced naturally and then revisited in later episodes to build depth.
*   **Culture is Key:** Cultural notes are woven directly into the story, reflecting Sophie's own learning experience.
