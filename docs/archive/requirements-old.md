### **1. AI Content Generation Pipeline Requirements**

This section defines the backend AI processes required to generate the core learning material (text, audio, images) based on specified parameters (language, CEFR level, topic).

**1.1. Core AI Models & APIs:**
* **REQ-AI-001: Text Generation (LLM):** The system SHALL integrate with a Large Language Model (LLM) API (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4o/GPT-4, Google Gemini 1.5 Pro, Anthropic Claude 3 Sonnet) for generating foreign language texts and image prompts.
    * **REQ-AI-001.1:** The LLM SHALL be capable of generating text in both French and German.
    * **REQ-AI-001.2:** The LLM SHALL be capable of generating text strictly adhering to specified CEFR levels (A1 initially), controlling vocabulary, grammar, and sentence complexity.
    * **REQ-AI-001.3:** The LLM SHALL be capable of generating descriptive image prompts in English, optimized for image generation models, based on the generated text.
    * **REQ-AI-001.4:** The LLM SHALL be capable of generating negative image prompts (what *not* to include) to improve image quality/relevance.
* **REQ-AI-002: Text-to-Speech (TTS):** The system SHALL integrate with a high-quality TTS API (e.g., ElevenLabs, OpenAI TTS, Google Cloud TTS) for generating audio from text.
    * **REQ-AI-002.1:** The TTS SHALL support high-fidelity, natural-sounding voices for both French and German.
    * **REQ-AI-002.2:** The TTS SHALL offer multiple voice options (e.g., male/female) for each language.
    * **REQ-AI-002.3:** The TTS SHALL accurately pronounce target language phonemes and intonation suitable for language learning.
* **REQ-AI-003: Image Generation (T2I):** The system SHALL integrate with an Image Generation API (e.g., DALL-E 3, Midjourney, Adobe Firefly) for creating illustrative visuals.
    * **REQ-AI-003.1:** The T2I SHALL generate images in a consistent, friendly, and simple cartoon/illustration style suitable for A1 learners.
    * **REQ-AI-003.2:** The T2I SHALL accurately follow image prompts generated by the LLM.
    * **REQ-AI-003.3:** The T2I SHALL be able to maintain visual consistency for recurring characters within a single story or theme (e.g., "Jean the beaver" looking the same in multiple images).
* **REQ-AI-004: Speech-to-Text (STT) for Pronunciation Feedback:** The system SHALL integrate with an STT API (e.g., Google Cloud STT, OpenAI Whisper) for evaluating user pronunciation.
    * **REQ-AI-004.1:** The STT SHALL accurately transcribe user-spoken French and German.
    * **REQ-AI-004.2:** The system SHALL provide actionable feedback on user pronunciation compared to a reference audio.

**1.2. Content Generation Logic:**
* **REQ-AI-005: Lesson Generation Endpoint:** There SHALL be a backend endpoint that, given parameters (e.g., `language: "fr"`, `cefr_level: "A1"`, `topic: "introductions"`, `num_sentences: 5`), orchestrates the AI pipeline.
    * **REQ-AI-005.1:** This endpoint SHALL first call the LLM to generate the foreign language text and associated image prompts.
    * **REQ-AI-005.2:** It SHALL then call the TTS for audio generation for the generated text.
    * **REQ-AI-005.3:** It SHALL then call the T2I for image generation based on the prompts.
    * **REQ-AI-005.4:** The endpoint SHALL return a structured JSON object containing:
        * The generated foreign language text.
        * The corresponding native language translation.
        * URLs to the generated audio files (e.g., for full text and individual words).
        * URLs to the generated image files.
        * Metadata (e.g., vocabulary list, grammar points covered).
* **REQ-AI-006: Vocabulary Item Generation:** The system SHALL be able to generate individual vocabulary items (word/phrase, article, gender where applicable, translation, audio, image).
* **REQ-AI-007: Grammar Point Generation:** The system SHALL be able to generate concise explanations and example sentences for A1-level grammar points.

### **2. Exercise Type Requirements (with AI Integration)**

This section outlines the specific exercise types and how they will leverage the AI content pipeline. Each exercise should have immediate feedback.

**2.1. Vocabulary & Recognition Exercises:**
* **REQ-EX-001: Flashcards:**
    * **Description:** Display an image, target language word/phrase, native language translation, and an audio play button.
    * **AI Integration:** Content (image, text, audio, translation) dynamically generated by AI.
* **REQ-EX-002: Image-to-Text Matching:**
    * **Description:** Present a grid of images and a grid of target language words/phrases. User drags and drops to match.
    * **AI Integration:** AI generates the set of matching image-text pairs.
* **REQ-EX-003: Audio-to-Text Matching:**
    * **Description:** User hears an audio clip and matches it to the correct written target language word/phrase.
    * **AI Integration:** AI generates the audio and corresponding text options.
* **REQ-EX-004: Multiple Choice (Vocabulary):**
    * **Description:** Show an image/play audio/show native word, user selects correct target language word from 3-4 options.
    * **AI Integration:** AI generates the correct answer and plausible distractors based on the current lesson's vocabulary and grammar (e.g., incorrect gendered articles).

**2.2. Listening Comprehension Exercises:**
* **REQ-EX-005: Listen & Select (Image):**
    * **Description:** User hears a target language sentence and selects the corresponding image from a set of 2-4.
    * **AI Integration:** AI generates the sentence, audio, and the correct/distractor images.
* **REQ-EX-006: Dictation (Listen & Type):**
    * **Description:** User hears a target language word or short sentence and types it.
    * **AI Integration:** AI provides the audio. The app validates user input against the original text, allowing for minor spelling variations.

**2.3. Reading Comprehension Exercises:**
* **REQ-EX-007: Read & Select (Image):**
    * **Description:** User reads a short target language text (e.g., 2-5 sentences) and selects the image that best summarizes it.
    * **AI Integration:** AI generates the short text and relevant images.
* **REQ-EX-008: Sentence Scramble:**
    * **Description:** User is given words from a target language sentence in a jumbled order and must drag them into the correct sequence.
    * **AI Integration:** AI generates grammatical sentences for scrambling, ensuring the scramble is solvable and tests specific word order rules.

**2.4. Grammar & Structure Exercises:**
* **REQ-EX-009: Fill-in-the-Blanks (Text Input/Selection):**
    * **Description:** User completes a sentence by typing the missing word (e.g., verb conjugation, article, pronoun) or selecting it from a dropdown/options.
    * **AI Integration:** AI generates sentences specifically designed to test a particular grammar point (e.g., German cases, French verb conjugations), and provides correct answers/feedback.
* **REQ-EX-010: Simple Translation (Native to Target Language):**
    * **Description:** User sees a simple sentence in their native language and types its translation into the target language.
    * **AI Integration:** AI generates the native sentence and acts as a sophisticated validator for user input, suggesting improvements or corrections.

**2.5. Speaking & Production Exercises:**
* **REQ-EX-011: Pronunciation Practice (Repeat & Record):**
    * **Description:** User hears a target language word/phrase, records their attempt, and receives immediate feedback.
    * **AI Integration:** AI (STT) transcribes user audio. Comparison logic (potentially AI-driven) provides feedback on accuracy (e.g., "Good," "Try again," highlighting problem sounds).
* **REQ-EX-012: Guided Dialogue (Role Play):**
    * **Description:** User plays one role in a simple dialogue. The app plays the other role (AI-generated audio), and the user is prompted to speak their line.
    * **AI Integration:** AI generates the conversational turns (text and audio) for the app's role. STT can optionally evaluate the user's spoken response.

* **REQ-APP-006: Progress Tracking:** The app SHALL visually track user progress through lessons and modules.
* **REQ-APP-007: Gamification Elements:** The app SHOULD incorporate basic gamification (e.g., points, streaks, lesson completion) to maintain motivation.
* **REQ-APP-008: Error Forgiveness:** For typing exercises, the system SHOULD allow for minor typos or capitalization differences, especially at A1.
* **REQ-APP-009: Consistent UI/UX:** The user interface SHALL be consistent and intuitive across all exercise types.
