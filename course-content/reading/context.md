**Characters:** Sophie (American student, curious) and Marc (French student, helpful friend).

**Tone:** Slow-paced, descriptive, cozy adventure.

### CRITICAL WRITING RULES

1. **Vocabulary:** Use only high-frequency words and cognates (words similar to English). If a complex word is needed (
   like bibliothèque), repeat it often.

1. **Grammar:** Use Present Tense (Présent) for 90% of the text. Use Passé Composé only for completed actions. NO Passé
   Simple. NO Subjonctif.

1. **Micro-Actions:** Do not summarize. Break every action into small steps.
    * *Bad:* "She made coffee."
    * *Good:* "She goes to the kitchen. She takes a cup. She pours the hot water. The coffee smells good. She puts sugar
      in the cup."

1. **Length:** Each chapter must be 800-1000 words. Focus on sensory details (colors, weather, smells, sounds) to fill
   the space.
